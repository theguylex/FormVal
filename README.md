# FormVal

## A form with Form validation implemented on it

Page exhibiting the functionalities of form validation where its inputs have to be validated before it can be submitted

* Create a skeleton page using HTML for the necessary elements
including a navbar, logo and form with a submit button. Include a burger icon

* Page is styled with blue being its main-colour and form being centred with adequate styling for the button as well. The burger icon is given a display value of "none" and only becomes visible in the media query for the required screen.

* Form validation is carried out using javaScript. In the Js file, the function toggleNav is created for the burger icon to be clicked on and displayed with consideration to the "active" class. Form validation is implemented using conditionals and regex.
